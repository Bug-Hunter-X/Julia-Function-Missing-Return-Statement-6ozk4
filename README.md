# Julia Function Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: a missing return statement in a function's conditional logic.  The function `my_function` is defined to square its input, but it fails to explicitly return a value when the input is zero. This results in an error, as Julia expects all control paths in a function to have a defined return value.

The `bug.jl` file contains the erroneous code, and the `bugSolution.jl` file shows the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of careful control flow when designing Julia functions.
